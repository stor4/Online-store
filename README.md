# JavaScript Online Store with Redux, Redux Thunk, and GraphQL

Welcome to our JavaScript online store, powered by Redux, Redux Thunk, and GraphQL libraries for state management and handling asynchronous requests.

## Project Description

Our online store is a web application developed using JavaScript. We utilize the Redux library to manage the application's state, enabling us to handle complex data flows and maintain consistent application state. For handling asynchronous requests and side effects, we employ the Redux Thunk library. Additionally, for executing flexible server queries and fetching data, we use GraphQL.

## Requirements

To run our online store, you'll need the following components installed:

- Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/ (if you haven't installed them already)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the online store repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repo
```

3. Install dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the application:

```
npm start
```

After completing these steps, your online store will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
